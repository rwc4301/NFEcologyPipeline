# NFEcologyPipeline

1. Install Nextflow & R

Make sure you have both Nextflow and R installed.

Install Nextflow:

```
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
mv nextflow ~/bin/
```

2. Set Up the Project Structure

Put your R scripts in the scripts/ directory, e.g.,:
	â€¢	scripts/script1.R
	â€¢	scripts/script2.R
	â€¢	scripts/script3.R

args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)
data <- read.csv(args[1])
summary(data)
write.csv(summary(data), "script1_summary.csv")

3. Write the Nextflow Pipeline (main.nf)

This pipeline:
	â€¢	Takes an input file
	â€¢	Passes it through multiple R scripts
	â€¢	Saves output results

4. Run the Pipeline

Execute:

```
nextflow run main.nf
```

If using Docker, run:

```
nextflow run main.nf -with-docker
```

5. Output

Each R script will generate an output file, e.g.:

script1.out.txt
script2.out.txt
script3.out.txt

Modify workflow to add dependencies if scripts should run sequentially.
